To complete the map, Ino\u0304 and his team took a total of ten surveying trips over the course of more than 16 years.

Based on a mathematical rather than a political-historical framework, Ino\u0304's maps stood in stark contrast to traditional state cartography. However, the shogunate largely kept the maps hidden from the Japanese public, and officials continued to use and update existing kuni ezu (provincial maps) until the collapse of the Tokugawa regime in 1868.

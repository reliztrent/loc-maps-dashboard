The wording of several place-names and other details suggest that this map dates from 1787-1820. An introductory text states that it was compiled in the interest of coastal defense. The scroll map contains hundreds of place-names and is intended to be read from right to left. Interspersed at irregular intervals are notes on sea routes and sailing directions. Distances are given in li, a measure that has changed length over time. The quality of the calligraphy and the cartography suggest that the map was made for the emperor. Shown here is the mouth of the Zhu Jiang (Pearl River) and the Macau area. The text reads: \"The coastal region of Xing Hui and Hu Men in Canton Province consists of an important strategic point, which should be given sufficient defense attention. This region is heavily infested with inner river bandits and sea pirates who can sail in and out freely. It also shares a border with Macau, where foreign boats and ships visit frequently. Those foreign vessels are always to be guarded against.\" The oldest permanent European settlement in Asia, Macau was established in 1557 by the Portuguese, who at that time dominated European trade with Asia.\" World Digital Library."], "title": "Qi sheng yan hai tu."}, "language": ["chinese"], "location": ["eastern hemisphere", "penghu county", "hainan sheng", "china", "taiwain", "taiwan", "macau (special administrative region)"], "location_country": ["china", "eastern hemisphere", "taiwain"], "location_county": ["macau (special administrative region)"], "location_state": ["hainan sheng", "penghu county"], "mime_type": ["image/tiff", "image/jpeg", "image/jp2"], "number": ["http://www.loc.gov/item/5403593", "gm71005022", "2023-01-11t11:05:23", "http://www.loc.gov/item/gm71005022"], "number_former_id": ["http://www.loc.gov/item/gm71005022", "http://www.loc.gov/item/5403593"], "number_lccn": ["gm71005022"], "number_source_modified": ["2023-01-11t11:05:23"], "online_format": ["image"], "original_format": ["map"], "other_title": ["\u4e03\u7701\u6cbf\u6d77\u56fe"], "partof": ["cultural landscapes", "cities and towns", "american memory", "catalog", "world digital library", "geography and map division"], "resources": [{"caption": "Part 1", "files": 1, "image": "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gmd:gmd7:g7822:g7822c:ct006401a/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/g7822c.ct006401a/"}, {"caption": "Part 2", "files": 1, "image": "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gmd:gmd7:g7822:g7822c:ct006401b/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/g7822c.ct006401b/"}, {"caption": "Part 3", "files": 1, "image": "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gmd:gmd7:g7822:g7822c:ct006401c/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/g7822c.ct006401c/"}, {"caption": "Part 4", "files": 1, "image": "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gmd:gmd7:g7822:g7822c:ct006401d/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/g7822c.ct006401d/"}, {"caption": "Part 5", "files": 1, "image": "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gmd:gmd7:g7822:g7822c:ct006401e/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/g7822c.ct006401e/"}], "shelf_id": "G7822.C6A5 1820 .Q5", "site": ["ammem", "catalog"], "subject": ["penghu county (taiwan)", "maps, manuscript", "maps, pictorial", "hainan sheng (china)", "eastern hemisphere", "coasts", "penghu county", "hainan sheng", "maps", "china", "taiwain", "taiwan", "macau (special administrative region)"], "timestamp": "2023-01-14T15:18:35.360Z", "title": "Qi sheng yan hai tu.", "type": "cartographic", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/gm71005022/"}]}

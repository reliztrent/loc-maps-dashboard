He worked in Venice in the period 1536-64, and in about 1544 he produced this sumptuous and well-executed manuscript atlas in pen-and-ink and watercolor with silver and gold illumination on vellum. The atlas reflects the latest geographic knowledge, gained primarily from voyages by Spanish and Portuguese explorers in the first half of the 16th century. A mere 50 years after Columbus's historic voyage of 1492, new information based on direct observation was rapidly changing the European image of the world. Maps one, two, and ten in the atlas all offer views of the Americas. Map one shows the Gulf of California discovered by Francisco de Ulloa in 1539, Yucatan as an island, and partial segments of the east and west coasts of South America. Map two shows the entire Atlantic Coast and parts of the Pacific Coast of North and South America. The river system in South America strongly suggests Brazil as an island. Map ten is an oval world map delineating the route of Magellan's circumnavigation and the routes of the Spanish gold fleets from Peru to Spain, with overland portage across the Isthmus of Panama. In the blue-and-gold clouds surrounding the oval world are cherubs, or wind heads, representing the classical twelve-point winds from which modern compass directions evolved. A version of this world map appears in each of the 71 surviving atlases by Battista Agnese. Maps two and ten include what are among the earliest depictions of Panama.

He worked in Venice in the period 1536-64, and in about 1544 he produced this sumptuous and well-executed manuscript atlas in pen-and-ink and watercolor with silver and gold illumination on vellum. The atlas reflects the latest geographic knowledge, gained primarily from voyages by Spanish and Portuguese explorers in the first half of the 16th century. A mere 50 years after Columbus's historic voyage of 1492, new information based on direct observation was rapidly changing the European image of the world. Maps one, two, and ten in the atlas all offer views of the Americas. Map one shows the Gulf of California discovered by Francisco de Ulloa in 1539, Yucatan as an island, and partial segments of the east and west coasts of South America. Map two shows the entire Atlantic Coast and parts of the Pacific Coast of North and South America. The river system in South America strongly suggests Brazil as an island. Map ten is an oval world map delineating the route of Magellan's circumnavigation and the routes of the Spanish gold fleets from Peru to Spain, with overland portage across the Isthmus of Panama. In the blue-and-gold clouds surrounding the oval world are cherubs, or wind heads, representing the classical twelve-point winds from which modern compass directions evolved. A version of this world map appears in each of the 71 surviving atlases by Battista Agnese. Maps two and ten include what are among the earliest depictions of Panama. Map nine shows the Mediterranean Coast.

It is dedicated to Emperor Leopold I of the Holy Roman Empire, who came to the throne only in 1658. The map was originally produced at the behest of astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) to reflect his new calculations of longitude and latitude based on planetary observation. First published in 1627, Kepler's astronomical tables were vastly more accurate than any previously existing. Framed by the two-headed eagle of the Holy Roman Empire, the map's design reflects the way in which in the 17th-century science was enlisted to serve political ends. The central hemisphere focuses on Europe, which is located over the eagle's body, while the eagle's wings span the entire globe. The imperial symbolism was used on Habsburg maps of the period and was an allusion to wars in the west with France and in the east with the Ottoman Empire. The central meridian runs through the Danish island that was home to the 16th-century observatory of Kepler's mentor, the astronomer Tycho Brahe. When Kepler succeeded Brahe as Imperial Mathematician in Prague under the reign of Rudolf II, he relied on Brahe's data to finalize his own calculations, known as the Rudolphine Tables.\" World Digital Library."], "digitized": true, "extract_timestamp": "2022-07-16T05:08:52.389Z", "group": ["catalog", "gmd.mar", "main-catalog", "general-maps"], "hassegments": false, "id": "http://www.loc.gov/item/2006627265/", "image_url": ["https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gmd/gmd3/g3200/g3200/ct001471.gif", "https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gmd/gmd3/g3200/g3200/ct001471.gif#h=150&w=252", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gmd:gmd3:g3200:g3200:ct001471/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg#h=631&w=1061", "https://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gmd:gmd3:g3200:g3200:ct001471/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg#h=1263&w=2122"], "index": 20, "item": {"call_number": ["G3200 1630 .E3"], "contributors": ["Eckebrecht, Philipp, 1594-1667.", "Kepler, Johannes, 1571-1630.", "Walch, J.

It is dedicated to Emperor Leopold I of the Holy Roman Empire, who came to the throne only in 1658. The map was originally produced at the behest of astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) to reflect his new calculations of longitude and latitude based on planetary observation. First published in 1627, Kepler's astronomical tables were vastly more accurate than any previously existing. Framed by the two-headed eagle of the Holy Roman Empire, the map's design reflects the way in which in the 17th-century science was enlisted to serve political ends. The central hemisphere focuses on Europe, which is located over the eagle's body, while the eagle's wings span the entire globe. The imperial symbolism was used on Habsburg maps of the period and was an allusion to wars in the west with France and in the east with the Ottoman Empire. The central meridian runs through the Danish island that was home to the 16th-century observatory of Kepler's mentor, the astronomer Tycho Brahe. When Kepler succeeded Brahe as Imperial Mathematician in Prague under the reign of Rudolf II, he relied on Brahe's data to finalize his own calculations, known as the Rudolphine Tables.\" World Digital Library."], "title": "Noua orbis terrarum delineatio singulari ratione accommodata meridiano tabb.

In 1560 he became interested in scientific geography during a voyage with Gerardus Mercator. Ortelius's major work, Theatrum orbis terrarum (Theater of the world), was published in Antwerp in 1570, at the threshold of the golden age of Dutch cartography. Theatrum presented the world in its component parts and reflected an age of exploration, broadened commercial connections, and scientific inquiry. Now considered the world's first atlas, the original Theatrum was enhanced by frequent updates and reprintings to incorporate the latest scientific and geographical information.

Halifax Harbor (leading to the Atlantic Ocean) is in the foreground, with many different types of vessels, both sail- and steam-powered, seen proceeding in various directions. An inlet called the Northwest Arm is seen on the far side of the city, with small hills in the background. Near the harbor, the city is dense, with numerous small piers extending into the water, many with ships alongside. At the bottom of the map is an extensive index indicating more than 100 points of interest in the city, including hotels, schools and colleges, churches, government buildings, and industry. A variety of other city establishments also are listed, such as the post office, police station, hospital, penitentiary, cemeteries, gas works, water works, the town clock, public gardens, and a skating rink. Near the center of the image is the prominent fortress of Citadel Hill, established in 1749. The panoramic map was a cartographic form popularly used to depict U.S. and Canadian cities and towns in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Also known as bird's-eye views or perspective maps, these maps are representations of cities portrayed as if viewed from above at an oblique angle. Not generally drawn to scale, they show street patterns, individual buildings, and major landscape features in perspective. This map is by Albert Ruger (1829-99), the first American to achieve success as a panoramic artist. Born in Prussia, Ruger immigrated to the United States and worked initially as a mason.

Halifax Harbor (leading to the Atlantic Ocean) is in the foreground, with many different types of vessels, both sail- and steam-powered, seen proceeding in various directions. An inlet called the Northwest Arm is seen on the far side of the city, with small hills in the background. Near the harbor, the city is dense, with numerous small piers extending into the water, many with ships alongside. At the bottom of the map is an extensive index indicating more than 100 points of interest in the city, including hotels, schools and colleges, churches, government buildings, and industry. A variety of other city establishments also are listed, such as the post office, police station, hospital, penitentiary, cemeteries, gas works, water works, the town clock, public gardens, and a skating rink. Near the center of the image is the prominent fortress of Citadel Hill, established in 1749. The panoramic map was a cartographic form popularly used to depict U.S. and Canadian cities and towns in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Also known as bird's-eye views or perspective maps, these maps are representations of cities portrayed as if viewed from above at an oblique angle. Not generally drawn to scale, they show street patterns, individual buildings, and major landscape features in perspective. This map is by Albert Ruger (1829-99), the first American to achieve success as a panoramic artist. Born in Prussia, Ruger immigrated to the United States and worked initially as a mason. While serving with the Ohio Volunteers during the Civil War, he drew views of Union campsites.

The collection includes maps of cities, maps showing Revolutionary War battles and military campaigns, and early state maps from the 1790s.\" World Digital Library."], "title": "[Etats-Unis: Partie septentrionale]."}, "language": ["french"], "location": ["canada", "north america", "united states", "great lakes region"], "location_country": ["canada", "north america", "united states"], "location_county": ["great lakes region"], "mime_type": ["image/gif", "image/tiff", "image/jpeg", "image/jp2"], "number": ["2019-01-07t17:14:48", "http://www.loc.gov/item/gm71002152", "2022-07-14t10:48:16", "gm71002152", "http://www.loc.gov/item/5401053"], "number_former_id": ["http://www.loc.gov/item/gm71002152", "http://www.loc.gov/item/5401053"], "number_lccn": ["gm71002152"], "number_source_modified": ["2022-07-14t10:48:16", "2019-01-07t17:14:48"], "online_format": ["image"], "original_format": ["map"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["france in america", "rochambeau map collection", "military battles and campaigns", "american memory", "catalog", "world digital library", "geography and map division"], "resources": [{"files": 1, "image": "https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gmd/gmd370/g3700/g3700/ct001261.gif", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3700.ct001261/"}], "shelf_id": "G3700 1708 .E8", "site": ["catalog", "ammem"], "subject": ["canada", "maps, manuscript", "great lakes region (north america)", "north america", "early works to 1800", "united states", "great lakes region"], "timestamp": "2022-07-16T05:13:37.102Z", "title": "[Etats-Unis: Partie septentrionale].", "type": "cartographic", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/gm71002152/"}, {"access_restricted": false, "aka": ["http://lccn.loc.gov/gm71005423", "http://www.loc.gov/item/gm71005423/", "https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3700.ar075800", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/g3700.ar075800/", "https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3700.ar075801", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/g3700.ar075801/"], "campaigns": [], "contributor": ["mcmurray, william", "scot, robert"], "date": "1784", "dates": ["1784-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "description": ["\"On August 9, 1783, Philadelphia mapmaker William McMurray placed an advertisement in the Pennsylvania Packet, a Philadelphia newspaper, for a map entitled The United States According to the Definitive Treaty of Peace.

Six shades of color are used to indicate the different levels of population density by location, ranging from fewer than two inhabitants per square mile (2.59 square kilometers) to more than 90 inhabitants per square mile. The most densely populated parts of the country are in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. The West is for the most part sparsely populated, although already by this time Denver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Seattle are emerging as major cities. Red stars are used to indicate the westward movement of the country's center of population, caused by a century of migration and settlement. In 1790, the center was near Baltimore, Maryland; by 1890 it had moved to a location in southern Indiana, somewhere west of Cincinnati, Ohio. A note at the bottom explains that in 1890 the overall population density of the United States (excluding Alaska) was 20.77 inhabitants per square mile, up from 16.58 inhabitants per square mile a decade earlier.

The most densely populated parts of the country are in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. The West is for the most part sparsely populated, although already by this time Denver, Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, and Seattle are emerging as major cities. Red stars are used to indicate the westward movement of the country's center of population, caused by a century of migration and settlement. In 1790, the center was near Baltimore, Maryland; by 1890 it had moved to a location in southern Indiana, somewhere west of Cincinnati, Ohio.

There he met George Washington, after which the combined French and American forces marched south toward the final campaign of the Revolutionary War, which culminated at the Battle of Yorktown in Virginia. This part of the map shows the proposed line of march of the French in western Connecticut and New York State, from Newtown and New Stratford to the Hudson River. It highlights a series of numbered French camps in red that indicate intermediate stops. Campsites south of Ridgebury, Connecticut, were in fact never occupied. The map has tears and other slight imperfections, particularly on the folds and creases. The map is from the Rochambeau Collection at the Library of Congress, which consists of 40 manuscript maps, 26 printed maps, and a manuscript atlas that belonged to Jean-Baptiste-Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau (1725-1807), commander in chief of the French expeditionary army (1780-82) during the American Revolution. Some of the maps were used by Rochambeau during the war. Dating from 1717 to 1795, the maps cover much of eastern North America, from Newfoundland and Labrador in the north to Haiti in the south. The collection includes maps of cities, maps showing Revolutionary War battles and military campaigns, and early state maps from the 1790s.\" World Digital Library."], "title": "Marche de l'arme\u0301e franc\u0327aise de Providence a\u0300 la Rivie\u0300re du Nord."}, "language": ["french"], "location": ["united states", "new york", "connecticut", "new york (state)", "rhode island"], "location_country": ["united states"], "location_state": ["connecticut", "new york (state)", "rhode island"], "mime_type": ["image/gif", "image/tiff", "image/jpeg", "image/jp2"], "number": ["2022-07-14t10:47:55", "http://www.loc.gov/item/5401062", "http://www.loc.gov/item/gm71002161", "gm71002161", "2019-01-07t17:14:54"], "number_former_id": ["http://www.loc.gov/item/gm71002161", "http://www.loc.gov/item/5401062"], "number_lccn": ["gm71002161"], "number_source_modified": ["2022-07-14t10:47:55", "2019-01-07t17:14:54"], "online_format": ["image"], "original_format": ["map"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["france in america", "rochambeau map collection", "military battles and campaigns", "american memory", "catalog", "world digital library", "geography and map division", "american revolution and its era: maps and charts of north america and the west indies, 1750-1789"], "resources": [{"files": 1, "image": "https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gmd/gmd371/g3711/g3711s/ar08300a.gif", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3711s.ar08300a/"}, {"files": 1, "image": "https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gmd/gmd371/g3711/g3711s/ar08300b.gif", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3711s.ar08300b/"}, {"files": 1, "image": "https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gmd/gmd371/g3711/g3711s/ar08300c.gif", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3711s.ar08300c/"}], "shelf_id": "G3711.S3 1781 .M3", "site": ["catalog", "ammem"], "subject": ["maps, manuscript", "revolution", "participation, french", "early works to 1800", "rhode island", "united states", "connecticut", "new york (state)", "history"], "timestamp": "2022-07-16T05:13:37.102Z", "title": "Marche de l'arm\u00e9e fran\u00e7aise de Providence \u00e0 la Rivi\u00e8re du Nord.", "type": "cartographic", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/gm71002161/"}, {"access_restricted": false, "aka": ["http://lccn.loc.gov/gm71002181", "http://www.loc.gov/item/gm71002181/", "https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3716s.ar074300", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/g3716s.ar074300/"], "campaigns": [], "date": "1782", "dates": ["1782-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "description": ["\"Co\u0302te de York-town a\u0300 Boston (Coastline from Yorktown to Boston) is a manuscript map, in pen-and-ink and watercolor, created in 1782, during the American Revolutionary War.

The mapped area covers the Delmarva Peninsula, Chesapeake Bay, and Delaware Bay. It presents in particular detail the anchorages and navigational hazards along the shoals and sandbanks of the Chesapeake and Delaware waters. Churchman shows counties, towns and cities, roads, industries, rivers, swamps, ferries, and the Cape Henlopen lighthouse. This map was one of only seven separately-issued maps produced in America during the American Revolution. No identifying date or place-name appears on the map, which was probably published about 1778. The name \"West New Jersey,\" which appears in top right-hand corner, denotes a division in New Jersey that was not completely superseded until 1790. Churchman signed an agreement on June 30, 1779, with engraver Daniel Few or Tew, who was to prepare the copper plate for the map. Churchman then presented the map to the American Philosophical Society on July 23, 1779. A committee of the society examined the map and recommended it for publication.

The mapped area covers the Delmarva Peninsula, Chesapeake Bay, and Delaware Bay. It presents in particular detail the anchorages and navigational hazards along the shoals and sandbanks of the Chesapeake and Delaware waters. Churchman shows counties, towns and cities, roads, industries, rivers, swamps, ferries, and the Cape Henlopen lighthouse. This map was one of only seven separately-issued maps produced in America during the American Revolution. No identifying date or place-name appears on the map, which was probably published about 1778. The name \"West New Jersey,\" which appears in top right-hand corner, denotes a division in New Jersey that was not completely superseded until 1790. Churchman signed an agreement on June 30, 1779, with engraver Daniel Few or Tew, who was to prepare the copper plate for the map. Churchman then presented the map to the American Philosophical Society on July 23, 1779. A committee of the society examined the map and recommended it for publication.

This was the first major battle in the Revolutionary War after the issuing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, as well as the largest engagement of the entire war. The battle pitted the Continental Army led by General George Washington against British forces commanded by General William Howe. The map highlights American defensive positions on Brooklyn Heights and Guan (Gowanus) Heights. It also shows British positions and troop movements from Staten Island and Gravesend in Brooklyn toward Brooklyn Heights. Howe gradually reinforced his troops from a base near the Narrows on Staten Island, and later moved to a primary British line near Gravesend (point A on the map). The British Army under Generals Clinton, von Heister (leading Hessian troops), and Grant subsequently moved toward Guan Heights (points B, C, D, E, and F). In the main action of the battle, which included a flank attack by Howe against the American positions, the Americans were defeated. This loss led Washington's forces to retreat to their primary defensive position on Brooklyn Heights, followed by a heroic escape back to Manhattan that was a high point of Washington's military career. After an American victory in the subsequent Battle of Harlem Heights, the British prevailed in the Battles of White Plains and Fort Washington, both of which took place before the end of the year. These losses ultimately caused the Americans to evacuate New York City, leaving this important strategic location in the hands of the British Army until the war ended in 1783. The map shows unusual detail for northern Manhattan, highlighting topography, buildings, forts, and the defensive positions of the American troops.

The ocean is shown at the bottom of the map, with the town extending away from the shoreline. Asbury Park was established in 1871 as an oceanfront community by manufacturer James A. Bradley (1830-1921), and was named for Methodist bishop Francis Asbury (1745-1816). The town boasted attractions such as a boardwalk with pavilions and a pier. On the map, the town has wide streets, ample trees, and three lakes: \"Wesley,\" \"Sunset,\" and \"Deal.\" A railroad bridge--part of the Central Railroad of New Jersey--spans the largest of the three lakes (Deal), and a train is seen moving toward the town. Numerous figures traverse the streets and enjoy the lakes and beaches. On the lower right are several large empty squares, labeled \"Hotel Sites.\" An inset image at the bottom of the map shows detail of the Asbury Park educational hall. To the right of the inset image is an index indicating the location of the educational hall on the map, as well as that of the public school and several churches (Presbyterian, Catholic, Episcopal, Reformed, Baptist). A notation to the left of the inset image reads: \"The growth of this popular seaside resort is unparalleled. There are now over 600 buildings, including hotels. In 1869 it was a wilderness and a barren sand-waste, assessed at only $15,000. In 1880, it was assessed at nearly $1,000,000.\" The panoramic map was a cartographic form in popular use to depict U.S. and Canadian cities and towns in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Also known as bird's-eye views or perspective maps, these works are representations of cities portrayed as if viewed from above at an oblique angle. Not generally drawn to scale, they show street patterns, individual buildings, and major landscape features in perspective.

Bradley (1830-1921), and was named for Methodist bishop Francis Asbury (1745-1816). The town boasted attractions such as a boardwalk with pavilions and a pier. On the map, the town has wide streets, ample trees, and three lakes: \"Wesley,\" \"Sunset,\" and \"Deal.\" A railroad bridge--part of the Central Railroad of New Jersey--spans the largest of the three lakes (Deal), and a train is seen moving toward the town. Numerous figures traverse the streets and enjoy the lakes and beaches. On the lower right are several large empty squares, labeled \"Hotel Sites.\" An inset image at the bottom of the map shows detail of the Asbury Park educational hall. To the right of the inset image is an index indicating the location of the educational hall on the map, as well as that of the public school and several churches (Presbyterian, Catholic, Episcopal, Reformed, Baptist). A notation to the left of the inset image reads: \"The growth of this popular seaside resort is unparalleled. There are now over 600 buildings, including hotels. In 1869 it was a wilderness and a barren sand-waste, assessed at only $15,000.

The map is an invaluable source of information about the battle, which took place on December 26, 1776. General George Washington and the Continental Army won a significant victory immediately after Washington's famous crossing of the Delaware River. The Hessians were German auxiliaries of the British in the American Revolutionary War. Wiederholdt was a Hessian officer in the Knyphausen regiment. He first enlisted as a private and quickly rose to the rank of sergeant major before being made an officer. After showing much dedication to his men, he was promoted to captain, the highest rank he achieved. Wiederholdt kept a record he called a Tagebuch, or journal, during the war. This personal memoir and the sketch of the town of Trenton and the surrounding countryside it contained were an important record of the planning before the battle. Wiederholdt was forced to surrender his journal before the court, and his sketch of the battle figured prominently in the inquiry. The three Hessian regiments were commanded by Colonel Johann Rall, to whom Wiederholdt incorrectly reported that Washington's army had Trenton completely surrounded. Rall died from his wounds and almost 900 Hessians were taken prisoner. The unscaled map depicts Washington's routes of attack and the Hessian and American troop positions during the battle. The town of Trenton is mapped in the northeast, the Delaware River to the south of the town, and surrounding routes for potential retreat in several corners of the map. Wiederholdt includes pictorial representations of rivers, ferries, and roads leading to Trenton, as well as vegetation and relief. The map is marked with notes on various landmarks and includes references.

The map is an invaluable source of information about the battle, which took place on December 26, 1776. General George Washington and the Continental Army won a significant victory immediately after Washington's famous crossing of the Delaware River. The Hessians were German auxiliaries of the British in the American Revolutionary War. Wiederholdt was a Hessian officer in the Knyphausen regiment. He first enlisted as a private and quickly rose to the rank of sergeant major before being made an officer. After showing much dedication to his men, he was promoted to captain, the highest rank he achieved. Wiederholdt kept a record he called a Tagebuch, or journal, during the war. This personal memoir and the sketch of the town of Trenton and the surrounding countryside it contained were an important record of the planning before the battle. Wiederholdt was forced to surrender his journal before the court, and his sketch of the battle figured prominently in the inquiry. The three Hessian regiments were commanded by Colonel Johann Rall, to whom Wiederholdt incorrectly reported that Washington's army had Trenton completely surrounded. Rall died from his wounds and almost 900 Hessians were taken prisoner. The unscaled map depicts Washington's routes of attack and the Hessian and American troop positions during the battle. The town of Trenton is mapped in the northeast, the Delaware River to the south of the town, and surrounding routes for potential retreat in several corners of the map. Wiederholdt includes pictorial representations of rivers, ferries, and roads leading to Trenton, as well as vegetation and relief. The map is marked with notes on various landmarks and includes references.

It shows the state of Georgia extending through the present-day states of Alabama and Mississippi. The map stretches west to the Mississippi River, south into parts of Florida, northeast to South Carolina, and north to the \"Tennassee Government.\" The map notes the location of Indian tribes, including the Chacataws (Choctaws), Cherokees, Creeks, Natches (Natchez), and Seminoles. The map is the first to identify Georgia's counties. Tallahassee County, shown on the Florida border, never actually existed as an official entity, only as an Indian name. Mathew Carey (1760-1839) was an immigrant from Ireland who worked as a publisher in Philadelphia, specializing in maps, atlases, and works of geography. In 1795 he issued the first atlas published in the United States, the American Atlas. Early American publishers such as Carey were not restricted by international copyright agreements and reused European sources to print extensive atlases and geography texts. Carey combined William Guthrie's European maps, originally published in London in 1770, with updated maps of the United States to produce Guthrie's Geography Improved. The map was engraved by William Barker (active 1795-1803), who was chiefly a map engraver and specialized in capital script. He made numerous maps for Carey's 1795 atlas.

The map is the first to identify Georgia's counties. Tallahassee County, shown on the Florida border, never actually existed as an official entity, only as an Indian name. Mathew Carey (1760-1839) was an immigrant from Ireland who worked as a publisher in Philadelphia, specializing in maps, atlases, and works of geography. In 1795 he issued the first atlas published in the United States, the American Atlas. Early American publishers such as Carey were not restricted by international copyright agreements and reused European sources to print extensive atlases and geography texts. Carey combined William Guthrie's European maps, originally published in London in 1770, with updated maps of the United States to produce Guthrie's Geography Improved. The map was engraved by William Barker (active 1795-1803), who was chiefly a map engraver and specialized in capital script. He made numerous maps for Carey's 1795 atlas.

This battle came near the end of the war, and involved Continental Army troops under the Marquis de Lafayette and General Anthony Wayne and British troops under General Lord Cornwallis. The battle was a minor victory for the British and the last land battle in Virginia before their ultimate loss at Yorktown. This map shows the town of Jamestown, as well as the battle site on the left bank of the James River across from the town. A lettered key identifies the troop positions of the Americans and the French, their maneuvers, and other points of military interest. The map also shows a mill, a church, a ferry, houses, roads, creeks, and vegetation. Among the sites listed are Humbler's plantation, and the properties of Monsieur Lralchfeld, Monsieur Wilkesson, and Monsieur Harris. Virginia was a colonial center of tobacco production, and many of these plantations were part of the tobacco economy. The map has a watermark. Relief is shown by hachures. Scale is given in toises, an old French unit measuring almost 1.95 meters. The map is from the Rochambeau Collection at the Library of Congress, which consists of 40 manuscript maps, 26 printed maps, and a manuscript atlas that belonged to Jean-Baptiste-Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau (1725-1807), commander in chief of the French expeditionary army (1780-82) during the American Revolution. Some of the maps were used by Rochambeau during the war. Dating from 1717 to 1795, the maps cover much of eastern North America, from Newfoundland and Labrador in the north to Haiti in the south.

Over the course of a long career, Fowler made panoramic maps of cities in 21 states and parts of Canada.\" World Digital Library."], "title": "Elkins, Randolph County, W.Va. 1897."}, "language": ["english"], "location": ["united states", "elkins", "west virginia"], "location_city": ["elkins"], "location_country": ["united states"], "location_state": ["west virginia"], "mime_type": ["image/gif", "image/tiff", "image/jpeg", "image/jp2"], "number": ["http://www.loc.gov/item/75696679", "2002-12-14t18:44:12", "75696679", "http://www.loc.gov/item/5425623", "2022-07-14t10:54:56"], "number_former_id": ["http://www.loc.gov/item/75696679", "http://www.loc.gov/item/5425623"], "number_lccn": ["75696679"], "number_source_modified": ["2022-07-14t10:54:56", "2002-12-14t18:44:12"], "online_format": ["image"], "original_format": ["map"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["panoramic maps", "cities and towns", "american memory", "catalog", "world digital library", "geography and map division"], "resources": [{"files": 1, "image": "https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gmd/gmd389/g3894/g3894e/pm009930.gif", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3894e.pm009930/"}], "shelf_id": "G3894.E6A3 1897 .F6", "site": ["catalog", "ammem"], "subject": ["united states", "aerial views", "elkins", "elkins (w. va.)", "west virginia"], "timestamp": "2022-07-16T05:13:12.480Z", "title": "Elkins, Randolph County, W.Va. 1897.", "type": "cartographic", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/75696679/"}, {"access_restricted": false, "aka": ["http://lccn.loc.gov/gm71002153", "http://www.loc.gov/item/gm71002153/", "https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g3900.ar139404", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/g3900.ar139404/"], "campaigns": [], "contributor": ["robert sayer and john bennett (firm)", "mouzon, henry"], "date": "1775", "dates": ["1775-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "description": ["\"This hand-colored map of the Carolinas dating from 1775 is known as the \"Mouzon map.\" Henry Mouzon (circa 1741-circa 1807), mapmaker and civil engineer of Saint Stephen's Parish, was appointed by Governor Lord Charles Greville Montague to survey South Carolina in 1771.

The Army Appropriations Act of 1853 provided for the completion of railroad surveys to determine possible routes. This map, issued in 1858 by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, depicts the United States west of the Mississippi on the eve of the Civil War. California and Texas were at this time the only Western states. Western regions initially became part of the United States as military departments, which only later were organized into territories and, eventually, states. The map uses colors to show the military departments and Indian lands. Brown flags indicate military establishments. In the lower right are listed all of the important surveys and expeditions that contributed to the mapping of the West, from the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804 to a survey of roads between the Sacramento and Columbia Rivers undertaken by two army officers in 1855. The routes of these expeditions are shown on the map. The map was compiled by then-Lieutenant Gouverneur K. Warren of the Army Topographical Engineers and a future Union general in the Civil War. Davis later became president of the Confederacy and a bitter adversary of President Abraham Lincoln under whose leadership, ironically, work on the transcontinental railroad began in 1862.\" World Digital Library."], "title": "Map of the territory of the United States from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; ordered by Jeff'n Davis, Secretary of War to accompany the reports of the explorations for a railroad route."}, "language": ["english"], "location": ["united states", "west"], "location_country": ["united states"], "location_county": ["west"], "mime_type": ["image/gif", "image/tiff", "image/jpeg", "image/jp2"], "number": ["http://www.loc.gov/item/5431575", "2022-07-14t10:54:34", "2019-01-02t17:24:53", "http://www.loc.gov/item/76695826", "76695826"], "number_former_id": ["http://www.loc.gov/item/76695826", "http://www.loc.gov/item/5431575"], "number_lccn": ["76695826"], "number_source_modified": ["2022-07-14t10:54:34", "2019-01-02t17:24:53"], "online_format": ["image"], "original_format": ["map"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["meeting of frontiers", "american memory", "catalog", "world digital library", "geography and map division", "discovery and exploration"], "resources": [{"files": 1, "image": "https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gmd/gmd405/g4050/g4050/mf000067.gif", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4050.mf000067/"}], "shelf_id": "G4050 1857 .W32", "site": ["catalog", "ammem"], "subject": ["maps", "railroads", "explorations and surveys", "west (u.s.)", "united states", "pacific railroads", "west"], "timestamp": "2022-07-16T05:13:12.480Z", "title": "Map of the territory of the United States from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean; ordered by Jeff'n Davis, Secretary of War to accompany the reports of the explorations for a railroad route.", "type": "cartographic", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/76695826/"}, {"access_restricted": false, "aka": ["http://lccn.loc.gov/gm71000833", "http://www.loc.gov/item/gm71000833/", "https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g4050.rr001760", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/g4050.rr001760/"], "campaigns": [], "contributor": ["mcgowan, d.", "hildt, george h.", "leopold gast & brother"], "date": "1859", "dates": ["1859-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "description": ["\"D.

Although mail was also delivered by ocean-going ships, plus a railroad across the Isthmus of Panama from 1855, and then north to California, overland routes comprised the major postal corridors.

The establishment of the Custer Battlefield Highway came at a time of widespread enthusiasm across the United States for highway construction, and the route quickly became one of the most famous of its era. It was based mostly upon existing roads, but it served as a catalyst for adding historical signage, upgrading maintenance, and building new bridges to improve the route.

Tens of thousands of prospectors from around the world streamed north to Alaska and the Yukon in a feverish search for fortune. This game, \"Going to Klondyke,\" was created in 1897 on the basis of news reports about the large initial gold strikes in the Yukon and in anticipation of the coming rush. The game was highlighted in the New York Journal on December 12, 1897. It was produced by the Klondyke Game Company of San Francisco, possibly for sale to the many prospectors who would pass through the port of San Francisco on their way to Alaska and the Yukon. The game tapped into the many myths surrounding the gold rush as well as the political realities in the Far North. The area of the game map covered parts of three countries: the Yukon in Canada (listed here as British Northwest Territories, as the Yukon Territory was established only in 1898, largely as a consequence of the Klondike Gold Rush), the U.S. territory of  Alaska, and Russian Siberia. The rules of the game were simple and are highlighted in a box below the map. Players were to be blindfolded, turned around a few times, and then directed to place a pin on the map. If they struck a gold nugget or landed within a \"claim\" circle in the United States (Alaska), they could win the full amount listed on the nugget or within the circle. If they did this in Canada, a 20 percent portion had to be taken out of the player's winnings, presumably to cover higher Canadian taxes. If their pin landed in Siberia, players lost everything to the government, as the Russian state presumably took all the proceeds of mineral discoveries there. The bulls-eye of the map was Dawson City, near the major gold strike along the Klondike River in the Yukon, from which all the circles on the map emanated.

It was produced by the Klondyke Game Company of San Francisco, possibly for sale to the many prospectors who would pass through the port of San Francisco on their way to Alaska and the Yukon. The game tapped into the many myths surrounding the gold rush as well as the political realities in the Far North. The area of the game map covered parts of three countries: the Yukon in Canada (listed here as British Northwest Territories, as the Yukon Territory was established only in 1898, largely as a consequence of the Klondike Gold Rush), the U.S. territory of  Alaska, and Russian Siberia. The rules of the game were simple and are highlighted in a box below the map. Players were to be blindfolded, turned around a few times, and then directed to place a pin on the map. If they struck a gold nugget or landed within a \"claim\" circle in the United States (Alaska), they could win the full amount listed on the nugget or within the circle. If they did this in Canada, a 20 percent portion had to be taken out of the player's winnings, presumably to cover higher Canadian taxes. If their pin landed in Siberia, players lost everything to the government, as the Russian state presumably took all the proceeds of mineral discoveries there. The bulls-eye of the map was Dawson City, near the major gold strike along the Klondike River in the Yukon, from which all the circles on the map emanated. The game map also highlights cities, rivers, mountain ranges, bodies of water, and contains scattered images of prospectors, Eskimos, caribou, bears, seals, penguins (mistakenly), and forests.\" World Digital Library."], "title": "Going to Klondyke."}, "language": ["english"], "location": ["united states", "alaska"], "location_country": ["united states"], "location_state": ["alaska"], "mime_type": ["image/gif", "image/tiff", "image/jpeg", "image/jp2"], "number": ["http://www.loc.gov/item/5576895", "http://www.loc.gov/item/99446193", "99446193", "2022-07-14t10:58:49", "2019-01-02t17:24:58"], "number_former_id": ["http://www.loc.gov/item/99446193", "http://www.loc.gov/item/5576895"], "number_lccn": ["99446193"], "number_source_modified": ["2022-07-14t10:58:49", "2019-01-02t17:24:58"], "online_format": ["image"], "original_format": ["map"], "other_title": [], "partof": ["meeting of frontiers", "american memory", "general maps", "catalog", "world digital library", "geography and map division"], "resources": [{"files": 1, "image": "https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/gmd/gmd437/g4371/g4371a/mf000035.gif", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/g4371a.mf000035/"}], "shelf_id": "G4371.A9 1897 .B5 TIL", "site": ["catalog", "ammem"], "subject": ["united states", "educational games", "geographical recreations", "alaska", "maps"], "timestamp": "2022-07-16T05:13:32.103Z", "title": "Going to Klondyke.", "type": "cartographic", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/item/99446193/"}, {"access_restricted": false, "aka": ["http://lccn.loc.gov/99446186", "http://www.loc.gov/item/99446186/", "https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g4371d.mfa00032", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/g4371d.mfa00032/", "https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g4371d.mfb00032", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/g4371d.mfb00032/", "https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g4371d.mfc00032", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/g4371d.mfc00032/", "https://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gmd/g4371d.mfd00032", "http://www.loc.gov/resource/g4371d.mfd00032/"], "campaigns": [], "contributor": ["united states. department of the interior", "petroff, ivan"], "date": "1882", "dates": ["1882-01-01T00:00:00Z"], "description": ["\"This multi-sheet map was produced by Ivan Petroff (also seen as Petroof and Petrof), a U.S. Census agent, in 1882, 15 years after Russia's sale of Alaska to the United States.

It includes both train and boat routes, as well as geographical information on the adjacent areas of Alaska, Yukon, and British Columbia. The reverse side of the map contains a timetable as well as vignettes about points of interest throughout the region. The map was made to be folded as a brochure. The map shows the full course of the Yukon River, the longest river in northwestern North America, in both Canada and Alaska. It also records the distance in miles between the maritime port of Skagway and many other localities from San Francisco to remote parts of Alaska and Canada, such as Saint Michael, Caribou, Atlin, and the forbidding Lake Laberge immortalized in the poetry of Robert W. Service (1874-1958). Although the Klondike Gold Rush had ended in 1899, gold was found elsewhere in Alaska, and the White Pass and Yukon Railroad continued to serve the need for a regional transportation system.
